// MARK: - BINARY SEARCH TREES: SWIFT

// A binary search tree is a data structure that is comprised of nodes in a branching relationship, each node having a key signifying its value.

// The basic rules are:
// The left child and its subtree contain values less than the parent node’s values
// The right child and its subtree contain values greater than the parent node’s values
// Each left and right subtree is in itself an implementation of a BST
